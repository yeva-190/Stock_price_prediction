# Stock_price_prediction

This project aims to predict the stock price of a company using machine learning techniques. The project is built using Python and relies on various data processing and machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

# Dataset

The project uses historical stock price data of the company, which is obtained from Yahoo Finance. The dataset includes daily stock price data, such as open, close, high, low, and volume, spanning over several years. The dataset is preprocessed to remove missing values, outliers, and to engineer relevant features such as moving averages, volume indicators, and technical indicators.

# Models

The project mainly uses machine learning model Long-short-term-memory or simply LSTM , to predict the stock price of the company. 

# Usage
