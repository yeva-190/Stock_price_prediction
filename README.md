# Stok_price_prediction

This project aims to predict the stock price of a company using machine learning techniques. The project is built using Python and relies on various data processing and machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

Dataset
The project uses historical stock price data of the company, which is obtained from Yahoo Finance. The dataset includes daily stock price data, such as open, close, high, low, and volume, spanning over several years. The dataset is preprocessed to remove missing values, outliers, and to engineer relevant features such as moving averages, volume indicators, and technical indicators.

Models
The project uses various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine, to predict the stock price of the company. The models are trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared. The best-performing model is selected based on the evaluation results.

Usage
To run the project, first clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
Next, install the required dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Finally, run the Jupyter notebook:

Copy code
jupyter notebook stock_price_prediction.ipynb
The Jupyter notebook contains detailed instructions on how to preprocess the dataset, train the machine learning models, and make stock price predictions. The notebook also includes visualization tools to help analyze the results.
